linen I would recommend to others, The staff were all very professional friendly and helpful The hotel was beautiful and the beds were extremely comfortable Lovely breakfast with lots of choice Very close to shopping Carnaby Street Oxford Street Regent Street Piccadilly about 15 minutes walk away Lots of choices close by for eating and just around the corner from the London Palladium Would highly recommend this Hotel and plan to visit again, The location was fantastic right by Liberty s opposite Carnaby Street It s a very short walk to Oxford Street or Regent Street and only few minutes walk from Oxford Circus tube station The bedroom was bigger than I ve had in other 5 star hotels at 3 times the price Also to find a hotel with a pool in central London is unusual and we thoroughly enjoyed our time spent in it The staff were all very friendly and helpful during our stay and we were very well looked after\n","Negative_Review: Nothing comes to mind, The hotel could benefit from some refurbishment in places but it in no way spoiled our experience, For a 5 star hotel I thought my room 415 was tired and in need of a make over the material on the chair was worn the bed was uncomfortable with a cheap mattress the cushion was tatty and frayed there was a big gap of over an inch under the door which allowed light and noise into the room the bathroom was clean and decorated to a good standard however the towels had been well used and not what you would expect in a hotel with these ratings It might well be that this is not the case for all the rooms within the hotel and I may have just been unlucky I had a great trip but the above issues were disappointing because there were lots of positives about the hotel and staff\n","\n","Hotel_Name: Landmark

d forget you coughed out a mini fortune So staying here whenever I m in London, Very comfortable room excellent helpful and courteous staff Only ate breakfast at the hotel which was very good with a very wide choice For a large hotel in central London it was very peaceful and relaxing Finally the Landmark is located in an area of the city with which I am not that familiar with but it is very well

linen I would recommend to others, The staff were all very professional friendly and helpful The hotel was beautiful and the beds were extremely comfortable Lovely breakfast with lots of choice Very close to shopping Carnaby Street Oxford Street Regent Street Piccadilly about 15 minutes walk away Lots of choices close by for eating and just around the corner from the London Palladium Would highly recommend this Hotel and plan to visit again, The location was fantastic right by Liberty s opposite Carnaby Street It s a very short walk to Oxford Street or Regent Street and only few minutes walk from Oxford Circus tube station The bedroom was bigger than I ve had in other 5 star hotels at 3 times the price Also to find a hotel with a pool in central London is unusual and we thoroughly enjoyed our time spent in it The staff were all very friendly and helpful during our stay and we were very well looked after\n","Negative_Review: Nothing comes to mind, The hotel could benefit from some refurbishment in places but it in no way spoiled our experience, For a 5 star hotel I thought my room 415 was tired and in need of a make over the material on the chair was worn the bed was uncomfortable with a cheap mattress the cushion was tatty and frayed there was a big gap of over an inch under the door which allowed light and noise into the room the bathroom was clean and decorated to a good standard however the towels had been well used and not what you would expect in a hotel with these ratings It might well be that this is not the case for all the rooms within the hotel and I may have just been unlucky I had a great trip but the above issues were disappointing because there were lots of positives about the hotel and staff\n","\n","Hotel_Name: Landmark

far the best hotel I ve ever stayed in and I have traveled a lot Everything was define from the comfy beds to the design to the extremely friendly and professional staff to how comfy it was for the children they absolutely loved it and made us promise to holiday in London again this year just so they could return to this hotel For me the bar was so cozy and nice the spa facilities well on the money I m still sleepy from the relaxing massage and facials I got yesterday lol Yes it is expensive to stay but it is a 5 star hotel with great value for money You will feel so good so much that you d forget you coughed out a mini fortune So staying here whenever I m in London, Very comfortable room excellent helpful and courteous staff Only ate breakfast at the hotel which was very good with a very wide choice For a large hotel in central London it was very peaceful and relaxing Finally the Landmark is located in an area of the city with which I am not that familiar with but it is very well placed within easy walking distance of many attractions including Lord s Cricket ground which was why we were there Robert Marsh, Fabulous from start to finish I had a refurbished superior room which was lovely in every aspect Bathrobes slippers provided plus hairdryer Loads of restaurants nearby 15 minute walk to Selfridges\n","Negative_Review: Can t think of anything, There aren t door men all

clean and fantastic space, When we arrived at the hotel they had overbooked and so upgraded us to their Tower Bridge hotel and paid for a taxi there At the Grange Tower Bridge they upgraded our room added a complimentary breakfast and arranged complimentary taxis to get us back over to the Covent Garden area of town The staff were excellent and I can t rate them highly enough at both of the hotels They were helpful with directions and things to do THe concierge staff in particular went out of their way to assist us, Great location for theatres British Museum Covent Garden and tube stations Holborn and Russell Square plus for Kings Cross St Pancras train stations It was a nice quiet hotel The room was large and spacious Staff were friendly and efficient Would recommend it\n","Negative_Review: The only thing was the price for breakfast which we thought was bit steep as it was 23 so we went elsewhere but other than that I couldn t fault the hotel and its wonderful staff I would definitely stay here again, Breakfast finishes at 10am and I think it would be great if it finished at 10 30 11am It would make the stay that bit more relaxing after a night out, I had to wait a bit to collect my left luggage but i think that was a one off situation\n","\n","Hotel_Name: Knightsbridge Hotel\n","Average_Score: 9.1\n","Hotel_Address: 10 Beaufort Gardens Kensington and

to South Kensington tube restaurants the museums and Hyde Park\n","Negative_Review: We are used to a king size bed so this double was a bit small for us but comfortable We felt that the bathroom was fine but the bedroom was rather small and for that reason the value for money was not as good as it might have been, Im disappointed with the rooms following the refurb I always loved this hotel because of its quirkiness and cool unique rooms Now quite frankly you could be in any Hilton or Novotel in London All boring cream colour and furniture looks a bit cheap When I asked it was apparently to create a feeling of calm I d say it was really just dull In a superior room I also expect a large double bed With a partner of 6 foot 5 small double beds are hopeless for us so I always book a superior room for that reason But I still like the hotel Ill just make sure I get a large bed next time and hopefully they ll keep some of the old rooms, I could nt say anything to improve as it provided what we needed clean modern room good location Husband would have liked breakfast included and thought 15 00 each was too steep even for central londin\n","\n","Hotel_Name: Jumeirah Lowndes
